rich applications that act like fully devel-
oped desktop applications. Python has a
great set of tools called Django for building web
applications. Django is a web framework—a set of tools

this chapter, you’ll learn how to use Django (https://
djangoproject.com/) to build a project called Learning
Log — an online journal system that lets you keep
track of information you’ve learned about particular
